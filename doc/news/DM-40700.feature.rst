Introduced the following scripts to position the respective telescope based on (az, el, rot_tel) coordinates:

- `maintel/point_azel.py`: tailored for the Main Telescope.
- `auxtel/point_azel.py`: designed for the Auxiliary Telescope.

The specialized methods were built upon the generic module `base_point_azel.py`.
